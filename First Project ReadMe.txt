Project Details

Data Communications Corp wants a small program that will calculate the cost of
UTP it installs for their clients. Write a program that will ask the user to 
input the name of the client, the number of feet of cable installed. The program
should then calculate and display a final bill. Cost per foot of UTP is .21 cents.
Be sure to add a tax of 6%. Final bill should include the total cost and client
name. Be sure to add modules to your program.
